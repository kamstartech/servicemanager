# Project Rules

## Prisma Split Schema
Never modify `prisma/schema.prisma` directly. This file is generated by merging fragments from `prisma/schema/active/`.

1.  **Always** make schema changes in the appropriate fragment file under `prisma/schema/active/`.
    *   Enums: `prisma/schema/active/enums/`
    *   Models: `prisma/schema/active/models/`
2.  **Always** run the merge script after making changes to the fragments: `npm run prisma:merge`.
3.  **Never** commit a `schema.prisma` that was manually edited without corresponding changes in the fragments.
