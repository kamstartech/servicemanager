# Architecture Documentation

System architecture, design decisions, and high-level technical overviews.

## Contents

### Workflow System
- [WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md](../features/WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md) - Workflow system architecture

## Purpose

Architecture documentation provides:
- **High-level overviews** - System design and component interactions
- **Design decisions** - Why specific approaches were chosen
- **Diagrams** - Visual representations of system structure
- **Integration patterns** - How components work together
- **Scalability considerations** - Future growth planning

## Document Types

### System Architecture
- Component diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Integration patterns
- Technology stack decisions

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Document significant architectural decisions:
- Context and problem
- Considered options
- Decision made
- Consequences and tradeoffs

### Technical Specifications
- API contracts
- Database schema design
- Service boundaries
- Security architecture

## When to Add Architecture Docs

Create architecture documentation when:
1. Designing a new major feature or subsystem
2. Making significant architectural changes
3. Documenting cross-cutting concerns
4. Explaining complex system interactions
5. Planning for scalability or performance
